Group Meeting
    - Discussed how we will write native api calls
    - l_modchannels.h/cpp -> native_modchannels.h/cpp
    - test mod is meant to test every function that was shimmed
    - for every function, you will need three test blocks.
        1) lua call of that function
        2) native call of that function
        3) compare test of the two outputs
        * for some classes, this exact triplet may not be the case
    - Source files to edit are in root/src/script (in lua_api, cpp_api, or native_api directories)
    - Server-side test files -> root/ mods/testingnative.../test.lua
    - There is an excel sheet where we can choose a class to convert
        - Says if it is server, client, or both
        - Says how many functions needs to be shimmed
    - once a native or cpp entry is made, must be put into the respective CMakeLists
    - official minetest documentation available on the confluence

    - Had a panic attack and gave up on the project.
