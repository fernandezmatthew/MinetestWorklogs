16:30 - 17:00
- Group meeting
    - Went over how the tests are actually working; not returning integers, returning stack variables
    - Discussing if we are splitting up or teaming up for working on a class
    - If we do team up, will probably be on object class
    - use ..res, ..tostring(res), ..dump(res) to concatenate test strings
