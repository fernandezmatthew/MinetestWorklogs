- Starting to define seperate l_native functions.
- Starting with a copy of the original l function to make sure test
    file is working properly.
- Will then edit the l_native function to make calls to a real native function
    defined in native_craft.cpp.
- Once this is done for all functions, I am done.

- Waiting on feedback from group members on if crafting works to begin with, cannot
    craft anything using the original lua calls
- Creating empty tests for the rest of the functions in this class
- Figured out that crafting isnt avaiulable in devtest worlds, but works in the regular version.
    Thus, I could craft my Mattblock from the Pre-Alpha

22:30 - 1:00 (2.5)
- Continued making initial tests for all of my functions. 
- My biggest concern is that the test format that's been described to me doesn't effectively
    test what it needs to.
- For the purposes of getting my class done in time for the Prototype presentation, I will use the
    described format.

- Had a panic attack and gave up on the project.

- But also helped Sean with some code
